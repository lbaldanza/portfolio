                <p>Hi, my name is Luiza Baldanza and I'm a 26 yo Brazilian Junior Web-Developer. </p>


                <p>
                    2019 was the year of change for me. I traveled for the first time to Europe
                    to live in Prague - Czech Republic, with my husband;
                    we've got a dog, an energetic Border Collie called Pixel and I decided to change my career (I'm a
                    bachelor in Law and
                    have a postgraduate diploma in International Law) to become a web-developer.
                </p>
                <p>

                    This has been the most challenging time of my life since the day Brazil lost of 7x1 to Germany at
                    2016 World Cup. :D
                </p>
                <p>
                    For all the programmers out there:
                </p>

                <p class="phrase-effect">Now I know, <span class="phrase-effect-not-magic">IT'S NOT MAGIC!!</span> </p>

                            <h2 class="section-skills-item-title">Well... I'm a talker.</h2>

                            <p>What can I say? I have a Law degree so I love to talk.
                                The university just helped me develop a skill
                                that I have had my whole life. If you let me, we'll be chatting
                                for hours and in the end we'll be best friends... or foes.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-skills-item-title">You may say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one!
                            </h2>
                            <p>Everybody say that a creative person has it's head in the clouds.
                                They're not wrong, but to be in the clouds it's the best place to be.
                                I love to do manual works, I draw, I paint, and now I'm trying to code.
                                Sometimes I overcome situations with some crazy thoughts.

                            <p>Normally situations of pressure don't bother me.
                                I can handle deadlines and I'm proud to keep my mind in order
                                when the world is crashing around me. </p>

                            <h2 class="section-skills-item-title">Go Team!</h2>

                            <p>For the past few years I've worked with every kind of person.
                                I have experience in being a proactive co-worker and an useful
                                teacher if needed. To be part of a team it means to be able to listen,
                                teach and learn always. A good team is capable to handle the differences
                                and have the job done despite anything.

                            </p>

                            <p> In the programming area I can say that this site is an example that I know some HTML and
                                CSS.
                                I'm proud of myself for making this personal page from scratch. It was not easy! Au
                                contraire,
                                it was a "roller-coaster" experience and, because of that, I'm glad to say that
                                I have a coding skill.

                            </p>
